        <div class="pre">
          
            跑团 is essentially a TRPG(Table-top Role Playing Game) tabletop game where players play a custom character to create 
            and advance a unique adventure story within the context of the story set by the game host——KP. COC TRPG, on the other hand, 
            refers specifically to a TRPG game set in the context of the Cthulhu mythology system, in which a wide variety of scripts are available.<br>
            TRPG games have been popular abroad for a long time, and their variety is most classic with DND and COC. DND focuses on combat, 
            while COC focuses on story building. Because these games are translated from foreign sources, they have been slow to develop in China. 
            The complex DND threshold is high, while in recent years, Cthulhu culture with its own reliance on the Cthulhu style works gradually 
            penetrate the game, comics, and novels, the COC TRPG is emerging in China.<br>
            In mainland China, Bilibili first began to promote COC TRPG
             videos, there are many videos played over ten million times.
             The increase in popularity made the number of people playing the game also become more and more. Currently, the mainstream of 
             people playing this game in China is online, the QQ groups I am in are all QQ groups with several thousand active users and 
             this number is still increasing, the rising number of users provides the impetus for the game to build a full business model 
             in China.<br>
            Since this game is still in its growth stage, although domestic users have figured out a mode of playing it on their own, 
            there are still many problems in the delivery of information. 
            In order to make it easier for more players to collect information and absorb more members, 
            I would like to build this website.
