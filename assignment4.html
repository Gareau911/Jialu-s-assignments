                   USERS ASK ME TO BUILD A COMMUNITY
        </div>

        <div class="pre">
          The most important steps in the process of a player completing a game can be simply summarized in three: <br>
          finding a module<br> finding a player<br> making character cards<br> <hr>
          My website is mainly about improving these three processes. Currently, to successfully play a game, 
          a player needs to browse various module websites to find a module; to find a player, 
          he needs to post a recruitment message on various social media platforms and wait for it, 
          or happen to come across a recruitment message in his free time (the chance is extremely small); 
          and to find a special dice website for a character card. The current Journey Map process is cumbersome and has a very low success rate.
            <hr>
           I expect to build a site that integrates these three steps to improve the success rate of completing a game by creating a 
           community of players. At the same time, this effectively enhances the initiative of players (especially PL), 
           allowing them to also recruit (in the past, recruitment was basically posted by KP only and only very experienced players can 
           be KP) and to choose their favorite stories. In addition, modules are the most important part for most players, 
           so I will add the function of module purchase to the website so that more good modules can be discovered and more good 
           module creators can be supported.
           <hr>
           After I designed the web structure, I conducted usability tests to verify the monetization logic to attract targeted 
           players to buy modules and join the community. It turned out that more community building was needed to allow players 
           to communicate with each other, use player comments to attract users to buy modules, and use the private chat feature 
           to strengthen the social connection between unfamiliar players. Doing these two things can better help the target audience 
           successfully start a game.
